This directory contains the collection of tests we performed and decided to insert into the thesis, namely:
- Richards: In this directory, the tests related to the Richards's problem are contained. In particular:
    - 'primal_L_test.py' and 'dual_L_test.py' will reproduce the tests on the benchmark problem with the L-scheme (variable L, variable N, variable time step length)
    - 'primal_mesh_test.py' and 'dual_mesh_test.py' will reproduce the tests on the benchmark problem with the modified Picard method, the Newton method and the L-scheme (with $L_1=3.5 \cdot 10^{-2}$ and $L_2=4.5 \cdot 10^{-2}$)
    - 'primal_single_stage.ipynb' and 'dual_single_stage.ipynb' are the notebook files that can be used to easily launch a Richards's problem simulation with a specific nonlinear solver
    - 'primal_multi_stage.ipynb' and 'dual_multi_stage.ipynb' are the notebook files that can be used to easily launch a Richards's problem simulation with a combination of nonlinear solvers (i.e., the first N iterations or up to a certian error threshold are performed with a specific scheme, while the remaning iterations are performed with a different scheme)
- Coupling Darcy-Richards: In this directory it's contained the notebook 'lagrange_multipler.ipynb', that can be run to solve the fixed-domain Darcy-Richards's problem with the $L$-scheme
- Moving Darcy: In this directory it's contained the notebook 'primal.ipynb', that can be used to run the moving domain Darcy's problem in both the formulation of the original paper and in the corrected version.
